# MarketPlaceMonitoring
Real - time monitoring and control of product positions on WildBerries marketplace, tracking paid ads and organic placement for precise analytics 

The primary method of product promotion on marketplaces is internal advertising. The first few pages of search results are largely composed of paid ads, meaning that sellers pay the platform to appear in higher positions.





However, despite this seeming transparency, the system can sometimes malfunction — product promotion may stop for hours or even an entire day, even though the seller’s dashboard indicates that the ad campaign is running. This issue can significantly affect revenue, especially for small private sellers.





An important point: third-party monitoring tools do not provide the same depth of data as manual tracking. These services usually offer averaged or once-daily position data, which is insufficient for precise analysis and control. In contrast, manual data collection can be set up to check every minute, allowing for immediate action — such as restarting ads if they unexpectedly stop.





In summary, this project is designed to monitor and control product positions on marketplaces in real-time.
